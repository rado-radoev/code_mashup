-Check if child db is empty
-    If empty - display a form to enter child Name and Birthdate
-    Save data to DB and hide form
-    Else if data already in child db, do not display form
-        Display baby's name, birthdate and age


-Calculate child age
-    User current date and child birtdate to calculate how many months
    That data will be used in the height_chart and weight_chart scripts
    to be displayed on the charts


When data is entered in the forms
    Update data in DB


Refresh data in graphs
    Create middleware to retrieve data from DB
    Add each entry to array. That will be added to data.addRows.
    Adding the data, use this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20712712/how-to-pass-variable-from-app-js-to-routes-index-js
