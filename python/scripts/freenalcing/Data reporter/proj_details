Simple HTTP data reporter

Hi, This project is about collecting status data from
a local device and reporting it to an online data logger for future analysis and presentation.
This is a small test project with a roadmap for future add-ons and more features.
I am looking at experience, quality of work, communication and documentation

Project Specs:
1) Phython script that can run on windows/linux , designed to run in the end on Raspberry Pi.
2) Settings include: data origin ip address, data destination settings (user+password+web address) and desired update frequency.
3) Display should show that last reported data and the connection status to both data origin and destination
It is possible to use the sample code provided from the data origin device if this helps to speed up things (will be provided)
4) A preselected set of information will be posted in the data destination online logger.

Milestone 1
Create a simple data request that will present the 3 types of data types
Create a simple data post with some dummy information 
Instruct on installing the right testing enviroment on a local PC (windows)

Milestone 2
Complete task, fix bugs

Milestone 3
Instruct on how to run this on Raspberry Pi

Additional specs

Data Origian - sample code exist
communicate using HTTP GET requests , one HTTP request at a time
interface looks like this:
Establish a connection rr_connect?password=XXX&time=YYY
Send a status request (rr_status?type=2) there are 3 types in total 1 ,2 or 3
rr_disconnect


Data Destination 

simple REST API for POSTing device data. 
You post a JSON body of properties, to https://xxxxxxx name of server xxxx
for example:
{
"$id": "demo",
"param1": 51.503530,
"param2": -0.127560,
"name": "My sensor",
"speed": 22.4
} 
We use token authentication so you'll need to supply two headers to the POST:
"Authorization: Token xxxxyyyyzzzz"
"Content-Type: application/json"
API key will be provided
Your objects may contain any properties you like, so long as they do not begin with $ (system objects)
