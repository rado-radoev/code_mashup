1. Get indoor temp and humidity and display them on the webpage
2. blink the led of course
3. use the motion sensor to activate raspbery pi screen when motion is detected

4. May be also use the light sensor !!!
5. if time of day is after 1 AM and if there is a light sensor, if motion is detected
   turn on the screen with white background (probably a webpage) and turn on full brighteness

   If no motion is detected for a minute turn it off
